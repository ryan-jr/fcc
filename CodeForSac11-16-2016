* Info services (BBG, REU, etc...).  Typically aquired info is through buying, but that is changing

* Companies are leveraging newfound access to data e.g. data.gov from 47 data sets to 189k+ data sets

* Open data growing across sectors at the state, local, international and NGO/private sector

* Some companies doing interesting things: buildzoom (building permits/contractors), fiscalnote(bill movement, government strategy, bill analysis, etc...), CBInsights(Brings together private company data, pulls together a variety of data), Enigma(has big data analysis to figure trends, insurance etc...), Captricity(Takes handwritten data into machine readable forms), 

* Open data can help unlock 3 to 5 TN$.  

* A growing industry of 3rd party brokers is scouring the world's data ssets making it available

* Challenges include data acquisition(formats, accessibility, etc...), Data Quality(Is it usable), data understanding/maningfulness (Is it valuable/useful)

* Vigilant Searches and montors all the public records data sources all at once.  

* Normally this type of data has been warehoused, and it works if there is a fineite/consisten set of data sources, but if there's a ton of data that's always coming online you need something that scales.  

* With more data and stagnatnt/same tools there is overall less access, 

* Vigilant is like lexisnexus etc.. but connects into the databases and sits on top of all of the other databases.
