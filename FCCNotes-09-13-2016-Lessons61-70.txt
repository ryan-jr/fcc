-the <style> element in CSS can be used with classes (noted with .DESCRIPTOR) to stylize/colorize specific elements

CODE:

<style>
  .red-text {
    color: #FF0000;
  }
...
</style>

<h1 class="red-text">I am red!</h1>

-you can also shorten the hex codes (and limit the # of colors to 4,000) like so:

<style>
  .red-text {
    color: #F00;
  }
  .fuchsia-text {
    color: #F0F;
  }
...
</style> 

-you can also use RGB values:

<style>
  body {
    background-color: rgb(0,0,0);
  }
</style>

-Bootstrap is a responsive CSS f/w that figures out how wide your screen is and resizes the HTML elements based upon that to create responsive design.  

-to add bootstrap to anny app, add the following to the top of your HTML: 

<link rel="stylesheet" href="//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css"/>


-to have images show up as the correct width we use the class="img-responsive" notation like so: 

<a href="#"><img class="img-responsive" src="https://bit.ly/fcc-running-cats" alt="cats"></a>

-We can have multiple classes function on an HTML element by putting the classes we want in ONE set of quotations and separated by a space:

<h2 class="red-text text-center">your text</h2>


-bootstrap also has some of its own styles for certain elements like buttons:

 <button class="btn"> Like </button>
 
 -we can also add the "button-block" class to the button element, so that the button will take up the whole page width like so:
 
 <button class="btn btn-block">Submit</button>
 
 -otherwise the button is only as wide as the text.  

-the "btn-primary" class added to the button element will make the button element blue/specific in some way 

  <button class="btn btn-block btn-primary">Like</button>
